# Huffman Coding with Min-Heap in Java

This Java project focuses on implementing Huffman coding for data compression using a min-heap data structure. It allows users to encode and decode text data, creating compressed representations of the original text.

## Overview

In this project, you will find two main parts:

1. **Encode:** Given an input text file (`main.txt`), this program generates a Huffman tree to compress the text. It then displays the compressed binary key and writes the compressed text to an output file (`encode.txt`). Additionally, it calculates the number of bytes required both with and without Huffman encoding.

2. **Decode:** Given the compressed binary key and the encoded text, this program decodes the text and writes the original text to an output file (`decodetxt`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YazdanHaghi/Huffman-Coding-with-Min-Heap-in-Java.git
